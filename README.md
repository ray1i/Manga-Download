# Pixiv-Download
Download manga from pixiv.net

# Usage
1. Enter the URL of the manga's chapter list (should look like https://www.pixiv.net/user/######/series/#####, with the '#' replaced with digits)
2. The script will create a folder named 'pixiv-downloads' in whichever directory it's located in
3. Done.

# To-Do:
- pixiv changed the system to only allow image access if it's from the actual chapter, so you can't access individual images from url anymore, which this script does. find a way around this.
- check input to make sure it's in the right format
